My wife wanted a plant stand because our succulents had gone wild. She showed me an amazon item, and I thought, "$60? I can build that myself." So I did. It only cost $100 and took an entire weekend.

## Inspiration

Something like this:

The original idea was to buy two and have them in the window corner at right angles. The gaps on the shelves were a bit too wide, and too much space between the shelves for succulents.

Drew up some rough plans on how to build this myself.
