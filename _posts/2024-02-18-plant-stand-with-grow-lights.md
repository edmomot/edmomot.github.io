My wife wanted a plant stand because our succulents had gone wild. She showed me an amazon item, and I thought, "$60? I can build that myself." So I did. It only cost $100 and took an entire weekend.

## Inspiration

Something like this:
https://www.amazon.com/ROSSNY-Bamboo-Outdoor-Multiple-Planter/dp/B08TH15BDH

The original idea was to buy two and have them in the window corner at right angles. The gaps on the shelves were a bit too wide, and too much space between the shelves for succulents.

Drew up some rough plans on how to build this myself.

## Materials

1x2 pine from menards. A mix of the cheaper and nicer boards. The nicer ones would be for the frame, and the cheaper would be ripped into 3 for shelf slats.

## Frame

The frame is made of four components: Base, back, left, and right. Shelves would fit on both sides of the left/right bars, and would be supported by the back for the outer shelves.

I cut the boards to length and joined with pocket holes and glue. Hid the pocket holes on faces that wouldn't be visible. I did a poor job aligning the faces, so I paid for that with aggressive sanding later. Learned why face clamps exist. Will probably buy those next time, or at least use my F clamps.

## Shelves

Using my 3d printed featherboard, I ripped some 1x2 pine into thirds. Dialing in the cut took some math that I quickly abandoned in favor of trial and error.

To make the shelves consistent, I created a box frame, cut spacers from scrap, and made a nail alignment board.

The shelf came together with wood glue and brad nails.

Now to make 13 more.

Luckily this is a multi-core system and the IO-bound workload could be distributed across processors.

After a few hours, we were ready for a forklift themed party.

I'm not Finnish, I'm Ukrainian.

## Finish

Used minwax paste wax, applied with a rag before assembly. Tough to get into all of the corners. Applying finish before gluing the shelves together might have been easier, but I don't think the glue would hold.

# LED Lighting

Succulents typically want to be in full, hot desert sun for 10 hours per day. A window in the gloomy midwest doesn't come close. Lights are absolutely necessary to keep the plants from stretching and getting lanky.

Grow lights aren't anything special. Purple lights only emit red and blue. There are some claims that this is more efficient, and that's all plants need, but I don't believe that. They get the full spectrum outside, they should be fine with full spectrum inside.

I just wanted the brightest lights per dollar, and to make it look good on the shelf. Aliexpress LED strips are what I settled on.
