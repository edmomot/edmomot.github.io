My wife wanted a plant stand because our succulents had gone wild. She showed me an amazon item, and I thought, "$60? I can build that myself." So I did. It only cost $100 and took an entire weekend.

## Inspiration

Something like this:

The original idea was to buy two and have them in the window corner at right angles. The gaps on the shelves were a bit too wide, and too much space between the shelves for succulents.

Drew up some rough plans on how to build this myself.

## Materials

1x2 pine from menards. A mix of the cheaper and nicer boards. The nicer ones would be for the frame, and the cheaper would be ripped into 3 for shelf slats.

## Frame

The frame is made of four components: Base, back, left, and right. Shelves would fit on both sides of the left/right bars, and would be supported by the back for the outer shelves.

I cut the boards to length and joined with pocket holes and glue. Hid the pocket holes on faces that wouldn't be visible. I did a poor job aligning the faces, so I paid for that with aggressive sanding later. Learned why face clamps exist. Will probably buy those next time, or at least use my F clamps.

## Shelves

Using my 3d printed featherboard, I ripped some 1x2 pine into thirds. Dialing in the cut took some math that I quickly abandoned in favor of trial and error.

To make the shelves consistent, I created a box frame, cut spacers from scrap, and made a nail alignment board.
