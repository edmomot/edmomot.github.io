# How I sealed a sawstop contractor saw for dust collection

## Inspiration

Almost immediately after making a few cuts with my new saw, I started to think about how to minimize the mess. I found this website that claims effective dust collection can be done by sealing the saw to direct airflow through the blade guard instead of every exposed opening.

## Problems to solve
1. Wide open back

    1. Extra challenge: The motor tilts and adjusts up and down. This moves the belts also. Sealing this with some kind of flat panel would have to allow for all types of motion without adding any extra work, or I would get quickly annoyed.
1. Open front

    1. This knob adjusts the height of the saw, and moves side to side to indicate the angle.
1. Open bottom
    1. The entire bottom is open.
    1. Has the original dust collection shroud with 4" hose connector protruding about 1" below the leg/saw body attachment.
1. Open left and right edges
    1. Very close to the wing attachment edge, easily bridged with tape
1. Open front edge
    1. Irregular shape, no easy bridge to tape
1. Switch wires
    1. Small hole on the left side of the saw
1. Gap in attachment between saw body and legs
