# How I sealed a sawstop contractor saw for dust collection

# Inspiration

Almost immediately after making a few cuts with my new saw, I started to think about how to minimize the mess. I found this website that claims effective dust collection can be done by sealing the saw to direct airflow through the blade guard instead of every exposed opening.

# Problems

## Wide open back
The back of the saw is wide open. The motor tilts and adjusts up and down. This moves the belts. Sealing this with some kind of flat panel would have to allow for all types of motion without adding any extra work, or I would get quickly annoyed.

### Solution: big box. With an outfeed table extension.

One drawback of the sawstop contractor saw is that the motor hangs off the back, which adds to the overall space it takes up. If the space is lost anyway, I might as well extend the table to use that space.

There are many options for outfeed extension tables. Folding, separate, built-in. 

This forum post has a handy collection of options that I used for inspiration:

I wanted a permanent extension that used up the "free" space and gave me a frame to enclose the motor.

I started from the edges and worked in.

### Left

On the left side, I cut a board to sit flush with the table (more extension!) with a recess for plywood to sit flush in the rear.

Drilled some holes for bolts and used a forstener bit to recess the bolt head to be flush with the surface.

### Right

On the right side, I mounted a board under with drywall screws instead of extending and drilling.

In hindsight, using the same strategy here as the left side and drilling some bolt holes would have made alignment of the back long boards more straightforward.

### Inner rear

I used the existing hole in the rear rail to mount a board so that a piece of plywood would sit flush on top with the table. The rail was not perfectly level, so I had to shave down the board in multiple spots to get a truly flush fit. A hand plane would have made this go quicker, but some files and an electric sander got the job done.

I used a straight edge and a scrap piece of lumber to check the fit, making sure nothing sliding toward the rear would catch the lip of the extension table.

Needed to make a couple holes bigger to fit my bolts. Quick drilling fixed that.

### Outer rear

I used a roughly 1.5"x1.5" board to stretch across the back. This is where a problem from earlier showed up. Drilling a lag bolt to attach this, the knot from the left board showed how weak it was.

Because I can't admit my mistake and cut another one, I charged forward and reinforced with a second block between the long boards using pocket screws. I also packed the knot with wood glue and sawdust, thinking it's better than nothing, but realistically probably adds 0.5% strength.

This took over 24 hours to dry. Probably not structural but it makes me feel better than having an empty hole.

Shaved and sanded flush.

### Plywood surface

I had some plywood scrap but not long enough for the full width. So I went ahead and ripped the sheet the wrong direction and immediately face-palmed. The grain was running perpendicular to the cutting direction, which probably adds some friction.

Still, I moved ahead. I didn't want to stitch the surface together from three pieces for the grain to be correct.

The next problem is that at 45, the motor bumps into the bottom of this face.

A Forstener bit and a chisel solved this.

This also shows some reinforcement I carefully added from scraps using glue and brads. The grooves I cut for the miter slot felt too thin and weak.

My carefully added scraps caused two problems later: clearance when sitting in my frame, and clearance with the box enclosure I added later. Both problems were solved with a hand saw and chisel. Hinsight, should have added these at the end.
